# 1. Deploying your first blueprint

If everything went to plan, you should have your Vamp installation up & running. If not, please check [how to install
Vamp](/getting-started/)

## Step 1: Deploying a monolith

Imagine you or the company you work for still use monolithic applications. I know, it sounds far fetched...
This application is conveniently called *Sava monolith* and is at version 1.0.  

You've managed to wrap your monolith in a Docker container, which lives in the Docker hub under `magneticio/sava:1.0.0`. Your app normally runs on port `8080` but you want to expose it under port `9050` in this case. Let's deploy this to Vamp using the following simple blueprint. Don't worry too much about what means what: we'll get there.

{{% copyable %}}
```yaml
---
name: sava:1.0
gateways:
  9050: sava/port
clusters:
  sava:
    services:
      breed:
        name: sava:1.0.0
        deployable: magneticio/sava:1.0.0
        ports:
          port: 8080/http
      scale:
        cpu: 0.2       
        memory: 64
        instances: 1
```
{{% /copyable %}}


In the Vamp UI, go to the **blueprints** tab, click the **Add new** button. Paste in the above blueprint and press **Save**. Vamp will store the blueprint and make it available for deployment. Just press the **Deploy button**.

Alternatively, you can your favorite tools like [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/), [HTTPie](https://github.com/jakubroztocil/httpie) or Curl to post this blueprint directly to the `api/v1/deployments` endpoint of Vamp. 

>**Note**: Take care to set the correct `Content-Type: application/x-yaml` header on the POST request. Vamp is kinda
strict with regard to content types, because we support JSON and YAML so we need to know what you are sending. 

Using `curl`:

```
curl -v -X POST --data-binary @sava_1.0.yaml -H "Content-Type: application/x-yaml" http://localhost:8080/api/v1/deployments
```

Using `httpie`:

```
http POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/deployments Content-Type:application/x-yaml < sava_1.0.yaml
```

>**Note**: If you run on Docker machine, use `docker-machine ip default` instead of `localhost`, e.g.
```
http POST http://`docker-machine ip default`:8080/api/v1/deployments Content-Type:application/x-yaml < sava_1.0.yaml
```

After POST-ing, Vamp should respond with a `202 Accepted` message and return a JSON blob. This means Vamp is trying to deploy your container. You'll notice some parts are filled in for you, like a default scale, a default routing and of course a UUID as a name.

>**Note**: Using RESTful API it is possible to created deployment with a custom name - simple `PUT` request to `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/deployments/DEPLOYMENT_CUSTOM_NAME`

## Step 2: Checking out our application

You can follow the deployment process of our container by checking the `/api/v1/deployments` endpoint and checking when the `state` field changes from `ReadyForDeployment` to `Deployed`. You can also check Marathon's GUI.

When the application is fully deployed you can check it out at Vamp host address + the port that was assigned in the blueprint, e.g: `http://10.26.184.254:9050/`. It should report a refreshing [hipster lorem ipsum](http://hipsterjesus.com/) upon each reload.

## Step 3: Getting some metrics

Using a simple tool like (Apache Bench)(https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/programs/ab.html) we can put some load on our application and see some of the metrics flowing into the dashboard. Using the following command send 10000 requests using 15 threads to our Sava app.

```bash
ab -k -c 15 -n 10000 http://localhost:9050/
```
or
```bash
ab -k -c 15 -n 10000 http://`docker-machine ip default`:9050/
```

You should see the metrics spike and some pretty charts being drawn:

Ok, that's great! Now let's do a canary release in [the second part of this getting started tutorial â†’](/documentation/guides/getting-started-tutorial/2-canary-release/)
